# launch_claude.sh — start Claude Code pointed at the local oMLX endpoint.
#
# Encodes the launch sequence + the gotchas logged in docs/journal.md:
#   - unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY first (a real cloud key conflicts with the
#     launcher's auth token and silently sends traffic to the cloud)
#   - verify oMLX is actually serving before launching (saves a confusing
#     "connection refused" mid-session)
#   - pin the model deliberately (the dashboard default has drifted to Qwen
#     before; D015 says the trusted default is Gemma 31B + MTP)
#
# Usage:
#   ./launch_claude.sh                 # uses the default model below
#   ./launch_claude.sh MODEL_NAME      # override for one launch
#
# In-session gotcha (not scriptable): if Claude Code resolves the wrong model
# anyway, type /model inside it — a stale stored preference can override env
# vars. This script can't fix that; the /model command inside the session can.
